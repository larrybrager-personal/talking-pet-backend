- [ ] Add integration coverage that exercises full Supabase upload + Replicate video persistence end-to-end once service mocks are available.
- [ ] Investigate adding request correlation IDs to outbound Replicate and Supabase calls for improved observability.
- [ ] Capture and surface Supabase cleanup failures so atomic rollback issues are observable in monitoring.
